By comparing our three graphs, we can see that Adaptive Random Forrest was the strongest model out of the seven. Our table of average accuracies supports this claim as it consistently got the strongest average accuracy of all models for the three streams. This is not hard to believe, since when going back to our first assignment of drug classification, Random Forest was also the highest ranking model. Hence, it makes sense that adapted to data streams, it would also perform well, as this meant each base tree of the random forest was equipped with a drift detector which started training when a warning was detected, and would replace the base trees when a drift was detected. The second best model was SAMKNN, which targets new concepts with its Self Adjusting Memory (SAM) while also retaining past concepts with its Long Term Memory (LTM). It got second place on all streams for average prequential accuracies, as seen on the table, and even briefly outperformed Adaptive Random Forest around the 10 000th sample on the gradual stream graph. As the worst models, No Change and Majority Class were the only ones to get under 40% average prequential accuracy on the table for all streams. 

For drift detection, I used the Page Hinkley algorithm to start training from scratch a new Hoeffding Adaptive Tree model when a drift was detected. When looking at the abrupt stream, Hoeffding Adaptive Tree with Drift Detect was able to spike its prequential accuracy when a change was detected, while the normal Hoeffding Adaptive Tree simply drops at those same spots. On the gradual stream, while the model with Drift Detect slightly drops under the normal model around the 10 000th sample, the normal model then drops much lower than the  model with Drift Detect later around the 15 000th sample. For the incremental stream,  the model with Drift Detect also seems to once again perform better than the  normal model. The table of average prequential accuracy supports the claim that Drift Detect helped the model as it got a higher average prequential accuracy than the normal model on all three streams.


When comparing our results to the research paper, we can see similarly on figure 27 that Adaptive Random Forest was also their strongest model, and No Change and Majority Class also their worst performing model. A difference between our projects was that the paper considered both balanced and imbalanced versions of the streams.
